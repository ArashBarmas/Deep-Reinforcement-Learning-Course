### Policy Based Methods Tutorials:

1. Cross Entropy Method: 

Train an agent using OpenAI Gym's MountainCarContinuous environment with a Cross Entropy optimization which iteratively suggests a small number of neighboring policies(weights), and uses a small percentage 
of the best performing policies to calculate a new estimate.

2. Hill Climbing: 

Train an agent using OpenAI Gym's Cartpole environment with a Hill Climbing optimization which iteratively purturbs the values of the current best estimate of weights and use those weights if it yields higher return.
